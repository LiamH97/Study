# 📚 Roadmap: Becoming Proficient in Go & Building Real Software

A learning path for a new software engineer who knows Python, wants to learn Go, design patterns, architecture, and system design — while also improving code quality and design thinking.

---

## 🏁 **Phase 1: Foundations & Best Practices (Language-agnostic)**
- 📕 [*Head First Go*](https://github.com/baoozuma/Head-First-All-Series-PDF/blob/main/Head%20First%20Go.pdf)
- Build small CLI tools or scripts
-  📕 *The Pragmatic Programmer* — timeless engineering mindset, craftsmanship
- 📕 *Clean Code* — writing readable, maintainable code

---

##  **Phase 2: Deeper on Go (Modern, idiomatic, test-driven)**
- 📗 **Learn Go with Tests** — idiomatic Go + TDD approach
- 📙 **Learn Go by Example** — practical, concise Go examples for real-world tasks  
  _(instead of *The Go Programming Language* book; more hands-on, beginner-friendly)_

---

## **Phase 3: Design Patterns (Structure & flexibility)**
- 📘 **Head First Design Patterns, 2E**  
  _(Java-focused, but great for understanding OO design principles and decoupling.
  Complement by looking up Go examples at [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/go/examples))_

---

## 🏗️ **Phase 4: Architecture & Systems Thinking**
- 📙 **Fundamentals of Software Architecture** (Richards & Ford) — big-picture trade-offs, scalability, patterns
- 📘 **System Design Interview – An Insider’s Guide** (Alex Xu) — practical system design problems & solutions
- 📝 - [*System Design Primer* ](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/master) - Amazing Resource, could be enough on its own as a foundation.
- Try:
  - Adding database, caching
  - Dockerizing your app
  - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Learn deployment on [Fly.io](https://www.fly.io), Render, Railway

---

## 🔄 **How to use this roadmap**
- Work roughly in order: foundations → Go → patterns → architecture
- Feel free to dip back & forth: learn Go basics, then read design patterns; prototype something, then revisit architecture
- Use small projects to practice patterns and systems ideas in Go
- Build real things (APIs, tools) to solidify knowledge

---

## 📌 **Optional next steps**
- *Grokking the System Design Interview* (Educative) — for more visual step-by-step designs
- *Volume 2* of Alex Xu’s book — more advanced system design topics
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* — when you want a deeper dive into distributed data systems

---

**Tip:** Revisit *Clean Code* and *The Pragmatic Programmer* often; they stay relevant as you write more real-world Go code.
