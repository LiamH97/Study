# 📚 Study Plan for Go, Design Patterns & Architecture (while working full time)

_Designed for ~5–8 hours/week over several months_

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Build real Go skills (main focus)

### Primary resource:
- [ ] **Learn Go with Tests** — main hands-on book  
  - Build small, real Go modules
  - Practice idiomatic Go: interfaces, structs, testing
  - Goal: feel comfortable writing small Go programs & running tests

### Companion (light reading):
- [ ] **The Pragmatic Programmer**
  - Read ~1 chapter per week (short chapters, high-level thinking)
  - Focus on mindset: thinking like a developer, communication, refactoring

---

## 🧹 Phase 2: Clean code & better design

> Start once you’ve finished about ~50% of *Learn Go with Tests* or built small CLI or REST app.

### Books:
- [ ] **Clean Code**
  - Read slowly, 1–2 chapters/week
  - Apply immediately to your Go code: better naming, small functions, clear modules

- [ ] **Head First Design Patterns (2nd Ed.)**
  - Read selectively (don’t rush cover-to-cover)
  - Focus on patterns most relevant to Go: strategy, decorator, observer, etc.
  - Translate to Go idioms

---

## 🏗 Phase 3: Systems & architecture thinking

> Start once you can build a basic service / small Go app

### Books & resources:
- [ ] **System Design Interview – An Insider’s Guide (Alex Xu)**
  - Read to learn common components: queues, caches, load balancers, database scaling
  - Sketch diagrams & practice small designs

- [ ] **System Design Primer (GitHub)**
  - Read summaries & diagrams to reinforce concepts

- [ ] **Fundamentals of Software Architecture**
  - Read selected chapters on layered architecture, event-driven systems, trade-offs
  - Focus on big-picture decision making

---

## 🛠 Ongoing habits & practice

- Build small real projects in Go (CLI, REST API, etc.)
- Refactor them applying:
  - Clean Code principles
  - Patterns you learn
- Write diagrams for each project:
  - Identify where you could add a queue/cache
  - Think about trade-offs

---

## 🧠 Notes:

- Don’t rush: quality > quantity
- Focus most study time on building real Go apps
- Keep books like *Clean Code* & *Pragmatic Programmer* as “bedside” reads, not homework
- Use architecture books once you have something concrete to apply them to

## ✏ Example weekly schedule (~5–8 hours):

| When | What |
|--|--|
| 2–3 evenings (45–60 min each) | Work through *Learn Go with Tests* |
| Weekend (1–2 hours) | Read 1–2 chapters of *Clean Code* or *Pragmatic Programmer* |
| Every few weeks | Sketch small system design based on what you built |
